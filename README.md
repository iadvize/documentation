## How to contribute

You have to create a branch and open a pull request, after that we will review it.

There is two way to do this, directly on github with the preview system on markdown files or in your computer with tools like [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) if you know how to use a git. After that We will review your pull request and decide when to publish it if it's needed.

You have to edit the file Documentation.md in a markdown format, if you don't know how to do this you can use [Mastering Markdown (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to help you writing markdown.
  
## How to test

You can test your branch with the route https://developers.iadvize.com/documentation/test/branchName. This route use the Documentation.md file of your branch directly without any cache system.

You can check if the rendering is right and if the global documentation with the generating menu is not broken. We will do the same check before publishing it.

## Production

Your changes will be automatically avaible when we merged it into the master branch.
