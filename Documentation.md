# General information
Welcome to iAdvize‚Äôs developer documentation!
If you want to use our API, create integrations for your own personal use or to share with the rest of the world, you are in the right place.

Early November 2017, iAdvize will provide you with a Developer platform for you to easily publish your apps on our marketplace so that our users can install them directly from their administration interface.

Whether you are a developer, an integrator, a customer or just curious, here, you will find an overview of how to get started, our Developer Guidelines, our API with practical examples and a guide to build and publish your future integrations.

## What is iAdvize?
[iAdvize](http://iadvize.com) is a conversational marketing platform that enables businesses to engage their customers and prospects whether they‚Äôre on the website or on social media from one single messaging solution (chat, voice, video). Visitors can get real-time advice from customer service but also from advocates, members of the brand community via [ibb√º](https://www.ibbu.com/en/) - our on-demand pool of experts.

Implementing iAdvize is child's play. You just have to insert a tag on each page of your website. Once the solution is deployed, your customer service and marketing teams are completely independent and can set up the solution as they wish.

The iAdvize platform has 2 interfaces:

* The administration: administrators and managers of the solution can configure the platform's settings and monitor the agent's activity.

* The agent's console panel: it gives superpowers to your agents. That's the place where professional agents or experts can respond intuitively to all the messages they receive.

## What is the Developer Platform?

The iAdvize Developer Platform allows developers to build apps and use our public APIs.
The beta version of the Developer Platform will be available soon.
As a beta tester, we will provide you with documentation and a private testing environment.

## Why to build apps to iAdvize?

There are three main reasons for building an app with the iAdvize Developer Platform: 

* You build apps and publish them for our customer community. (We've got more than 500 customers to amaze!)
* You build apps in private mode and make them available only for one or more specific customers
* You get rewarded based on how frequently your apps are used

Here is the example of a potential protocol between iAdvize and a CRM software thanks to a connector:
![CRM Webhook](./assets/images/CRM-webhook.png)

# Getting Started
Do you want to join our developer community as a beta tester ü§òüèΩ? Follow these steps to be part of the adventure:

## Get a Developer Account
To build apps that iAdvize‚Äôs customers can use, first, you need to get a developer account.
The Developer Platform will be available in private beta version from November, 17. We invite you to apply to the early access program thanks to our [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKbBBwHtXU60D0bw6dPejF1_h2VBiPAf60LpQWtJ7h6dvXeg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

* Apply and share your integration project with our team,
* The iAdvize team will contact you within 48 hours.

## Features Overview
iAdvize's Developer Platform will provide you with some easy-to-use tools so you can:

* Manager the privacy mode of your app for it to be public or private
* Set up the authentication process for your app
* Define custom settings such as object mapping (In progress)
* Create interactions to enhance some of iAdvize's predefined features
* Use outgoing webhooks to receive updates in real-time

Once your app is ready, you will be able to submit your connector for review.
Then, the iAdvize team will review your app to make sure it fits the Developer Platform policies, and will get back to you within 48 hours (on working days).
And then hurrah... You can publish your app on iAdvize‚Äôs marketplace!

# Build apps
Once you are logged in your developer account, you are ready to build apps.
So let's go through the different sections of the Developer Platform:

## My apps
This is the place where you can see the list of all the apps you have built on iAdvize. You can also see their current status:
* Published: your app is ready to be installed on the iAdvize Marketplace
* Under review: your app has been submitted for review
* Sandbox: you can edit your app

## App information
This is where you will be able to define your app's profile. Also, this is where you can set the Privacy mode of your application: public or private.

**How does the Private mode work?**
Your App can be available for all iAdvize's customers or for selected customers.
Our team is still working on the accessibility mode under the Private mode.
In alpha version, we will make it available manually for the specific customers you have selected.

## App Authentication
The authentication section is where you set your app‚Äôs needs to retrieve data from iAdvize and the app you want it to be connected to. Users will need to follow these authentication steps to install your app.

**Define app's authentication fields**
You can add fields and define the type of entry you need (text, numeric, etc.).

* Label: it‚Äôs the name of your field, this is what users will see.
* Type: it defines the type of entry. (For instance: alphanumeric)
* ID: you should choose the name of your field ID according to your code.

You can add as much fields as you need.
This is the first thing users will see once they click on the "install" button on the iAdvize Marketplace.
Fields appear to users according to their order of creation (the 1st entry created is the 1st on displayed on the page).

*i.e. if your primary goal is to know your users‚Äô usernames, it is the first information you should ask them for.*

**Configure your verification url** 
This is the URL on which we will check your app. It also helps us check if your credentials are valid.
Please read the [verification Url](#verification-url) section right below.


*i.e. users might be required to authenticate with an email and a password. In this case, you need to create two different fields, one for the email and one for the password.*

![Authentication](./assets/images/developer-authentication.png)


Users have to fill in the fields during the installation process first, on the iAdvize Marketplace.

![Authentication admin](./assets/images/marketplace-configure.png)


##App Settings

Just as in the section dedicated to your app's authentication, you are able to set the parameters that users will need to install your connector.
These are the fields that the iAdvize administrator will fill in to install and configure your connector from the iAdvize Marketplace.

Define your app's settings fields

You can add as many fields as the installation and configuration of your application requires.
For each of these fields you will have to specify the type of input required.

*Label: it is the name of your field. (This is what the users will see).
For instance it could be: Username
*Type: it defines the type of entry. (For instance: alphanumeric)
*ID: this is based on your own code to easily retrieve the different fields.

These configuration steps will take place immediately after authentication (if any).
The order of appearance of the steps depends on their order of creation. The first created field will appear first and the last created field will appear last to the user.

**Configure your verification url** 
This is the URL on which we will check your app.
Please read the [verification Url](#verification-url) section right below.

![Setting](./assets/images/developer-settings.jpg)

## Verification url

In the [app authentication](#app-authentication) and [app settings](#app-settings) sections of the iAdvize Developer Platform, you can set a "Verification url".
We will call this URL each time the application requires a confirmation from your connector to approve the configuration settings.
It means that your connector must answer to this call by a confirmation or an error message to determine whether the setting parameters have been correctly set up. If the first step is confirmed by your connector, it goes to the next step of configuration.

### Request payload

Here is the information sent to your verification url as a payload body of a POST Request.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
[
    {
		"id": "field_login",
		"value": "login",
		"fieldType": "TEXT"
	},
	{
		"id": "field_password",
		"value": "p4ssw0rd",
		"fieldType": "TEXT"
	}
]
</pre>

| Field | Description | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | Field's id | String |
| value | Field's value | String  |
| fieldType | field's type | `TEXT`  |


### Response payload 

In order to validate the information filled by the iAdvize administrator during the installation of the connector, we await the answer of your connector in this format:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
	"isValid": false,
	"message": "",
	"fields": [
	    {
            "id": "field_password",
            "message": "password is not valid"
        }
	]
}
</pre>

| Field | Description | Values | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| isValid | validation status | Boolean | ‚úì |
| message |  validation message | String |  |
| fields | field's array | Array |  |
| fields - id | fields's id | String |  |
| fields - message | field's message | String |  |

## App Interactions
Add interactions to enhance the iAdvize interface by adding or editing predefined features.

The features that are already available are: 

* The product List (on the discussion panel)
* The visitor profile (on the discussion panel)
* The end of conversation (on the discussion panel)

### The product list
The integration of the product list enables iAdvize's Console panel users to browse a product catalog from the iAdvize discussion panel.
Agents can look for a product while they are chatting and send it in just a click within their conversation.

Products are displayed in a popup window just over the conversations view: When shared, visitors can see their image, title, availability and price.
By clicking on the "view product" button, visitors are redirected to the product page on your website.

![Product list](./assets/images/interactions-product-list-feature.png)

**Add the product list interaction and configure it**
To make sure your connector uses the Product list interaction correctly, all you have to do is to declare:
* The product list URL - this is your catalog‚Äôs URL
* The categories url - this is where your connector will get the list of your product categories

#### Categories data

### The visitor profile

The visitor profile interaction enables iAdvize's Console panel users to access to the visitor's CRM profile in a single click. 
Agents can overview the visitor's CRM profile in a new window while they are chatting. Operators can then edit it or simply look for information.

To be able to retrieve the CRM profile, iAdvize must be able to identify the visitor thanks to an email and/or an external ID.

![VisitorProfile](./assets/images/visitorprofilefeature@2x.png)

**Add a visitor profile connector and configure it**
In order to set the right connector parameters, all you have to do is to declare:
* The connector URL - this is your visitor's profile URL

#### Visitor profile data

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
 [
    {
        "id":"1",

The conversation closing option interaction enables iAdvize's Console panel users to provide additional information manually at the end of conversation. 

![CloseConversation](./assets/images/close_conversation@2x.png)

**Add a conversation closing option connector and Configure it**
In order to set the right connector parameters, all you have to do is to declare:

### Submit your apps

Apps must be submitted to iAdvize for review.
The versioning declaration must be done by the developer during the submission process.
iAdvize will approve or refuse the app based on specific criteria.
iAdvize will get in touch within 48 hours to the developers.

## Webhooks (In progress)
The webhook system allows external applications to subscribe to events (via callback URLs) to receive updates in real-time.
When you build your app, you can subscribe to a list of events.
When customers install your app, it automatically creates webhooks for these customers as well as for events based on your app's configuration.

This subscription is based on the events happening on different domains. See the list of events available in the [Webhook API documentation](#webhook-api).

### Create a webhook for your connector
You can create as much outgoing webhooks as you need.
A webhook can cover several events.
An event can be linked to a customer (example customers.website.created)
or linked to a website (example customers.website.created)

* Name of the webhook: an optional label you can give to the webhook
* webhook URL: the server URL that will receive the webhook
* Security token: Token provided by iAdvize (this field cannot be edited)
* Content-type: Application / json ; Application / x-www-form-urlencoded
* Events: you can select the events in the list. You can subscribe to all
iAdvize events, all events of a specific domain, or only one event.


## Developer Policy
Developers host their code on their own host service.
Developers are responsible for their connector's maintenance.
Developers can set their app‚Äôs price (monthly fee per user).
If it‚Äôs not a free app, developers must be a legal person.

# REST API
**Current version:** 2.0

This API provides access and basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for the resources described in the documentation.
The REST API uses JSON exclusively. XML is not supported.

## Base URL

All URLs referenced in the documentation have the following base:

| Standard platform | High availability platform |
| --- | --- |
| `https://www.iadvize.com/api/2` | `https://ha.iadvize.com/api/2` |

The iAdvize REST API is served over HTTPS and HTTP.

## Authentication

The API key must be attached to each request. You can use it in one of the following ways:

*   Passed in as a `X-API-Key` HTTP header
*   Passed in as a `key` GET parameter
*   Passed in as the username <small>(with an arbitrary password)</small> via `HTTP Basic authentication`

## Delivery headers
iAdvize will send payload with three additional headers:

* X-iAdvize-Delivery: UUID, unique identifier to describe this webhook delivery
* X-iAdvize-CorrelationId: UUID, unique identifier used in retry webhooks to track same callback calls.
* X-iAdvize-Signature: Hash signature, cf. Security section

## Securing your webhooks

For security reasons iAdvize provides you with a method to verify and secure your Webhooks notifications. You will be able to make sure that the payloads have not been subjected to modifications, and to verify its source in order for example to limit the requests to those coming from iAdvize.

Once your server is configured to receive payloads, you can set up a secret token and verify the information.

### Set you secret token

First, you need to get one or several secret token depending on your project.

If you build a connector thanks to our Developer Platform, you will have to use one token per connector (no matters the number of webhook you set within your connector).
You can retrieve this token in the 'App information' section.

If you want to use the webhook system without building a connector, you will have to use one token per webhook.
To retrieve the token(s) you must contact us at developers@iadvize.com and we will generate the token for you.

### Validating payloads from iAdvize

Once the secret token set, iAdvize will create a hash signature. 
This hash signature is passed along with each request in the headers as `X-iAdvize-Signature`. 
Hash signature starts with algorithm name `sha256=` and is computed by hashing body payload with HMAC hexdigest algorithm and your secret token as salt. 

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
X-iAdvize-Signature: 110e8400-e29b-11d4-a716-446655440000
</pre>


You have to compute a new hash using your secret token, and to compare it with `X-iAdvize-Signature` and make sure it matches.
Here is an example of a PHP implementation:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-php">
$secretToken       = 'yourSecretToken';
$headers           = getallheaders();
$iAdvizeSignature  = $headers['X-iAdvize-Signature'];

// Get alogrithm and hash
list($algorithm, $iAdvizeHash) = explode('=', $iAdvizeSignature, 2);
 
// Get body payload from webhook
$bodyPayload = file_get_contents('php://input');
 
// Computed hash with body payload
$bodyPayloadHash = hash_hmac($algorithm, $bodyPayload, $secretToken);
 
// Final check
if (! hash_equals($iAdvizeHash, $bodyPayloadHash)) {
    exit('Validation hash failed');
}
</pre>


We strongly recommend you, to use the **constant time** string comparison method (`hash_equals` vs `===`  in our example), 
to be less vulnerable to timing attacks.

# Push API (deprecated)

The iAdvize Push API will be deprecated starting september, 2017. The Push API will be cut on january 30th, 2018. From now, prefer to use our webhook API (In progress).
The Push API allows data to be pushed to URI callbacks when an event is fired.  
The Push API uses JSON exclusively. XML is not supported. Push requests are sent with a POST method.

# Single Sign On

iAdvize offers a [Single Sign On](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) method that allows you to provide a unique authentication system to your operators who are already logged to your app.

## Benefits

If your users have to switch between several apps (including iAdvize) during their daily work, Single Sign On method has some interesting benefits :

*   Reducing password fatigue from different user name and password combinations
*   Reducing time spent re-entering passwords for the same identity
*   Reducing IT costs due to lower number of IT help desk calls about passwords

## Implementation

To connect an operator to its iAdvize console :

*   Get his sso_key in the [operator resource of the REST API](#operator).
*   Use it in the following URL : `http://www.iadvize.com/admin/login?key={SSO_KEY}`

That's all! When a user visit the URL, he will be automatically logged to its iAdvize account and no login / password will be asked to him.

## Use specific links

It's possible to use a specific link with a parameter called `backto` to go to a specific page.

Examples below:

| Page | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Discussion panel | `http://www.iadvize.com/admin/login?key={SSO_KEY}&backto=**/pupitre**` |
| Users | `http://www.iadvize.com/admin/login?key={SSO_KEY}&backto=**/users**` |

To find the parameter `backto` that interest you, look the URL address of the page in your favorite web browser.

![URL example](./assets/images/sso-url.png)

With this example, the SSO URL address will be:
`http://www.iadvize.com/admin/login?key={SSO_KEY}&backto=users/`
