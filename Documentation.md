# General information
Welcome to iAdvize‚Äôs developer documentation!
If you want to use our API, create integrations for your own personal use or to share with the rest of the world, you are in the right place.

iAdvize provides you with a Developer platform for you to easily publish your apps on our marketplace so that our users can install them directly from their administration interface.

Whether you are a developer, an integrator, a customer or just curious, here, you will find an overview of how to get started, our Developer Guidelines, our API with practical examples and a guide to build and publish your future integrations.

## What is iAdvize?
[iAdvize](http://iadvize.com) is a SaaS conversational commerce platform that enables businesses to engage their customers and prospects whether they‚Äôre on the website or on social media from one messaging solution (chat, voice, video).

Visitors can get real-time advice from customer service but also from advocates, members of the brand community.

Implementing iAdvize is child's play. You just have to insert a tag on each page of your website. Once the solution is deployed, your customer service and marketing teams are completely independent and can set up the solution as they wish.

The iAdvize platform has 2 interfaces:

* The administration: administrators and managers of the solution can configure the platform's settings and monitor the agent's activity.

* The agent's console panel: it gives superpowers to your agents. That's the place where professional agents or experts can respond intuitively to all the messages they receive.

## What is the Developer Platform?

The iAdvize Developer Platform allows developers to build apps and use our public APIs.
Do you want to develop an app? We are providing you with documentation and a private testing environment.

## Why to build apps to iAdvize?

There are three main reasons for building an app with the iAdvize Developer Platform: 

* You build apps and publish them for our customer community. (We've got more than 500 customers to amaze!)
* You build apps in private mode and make them available only for one or more specific customers
* You get rewarded based on how frequently your apps are used

Here is the example of a potential protocol between iAdvize and a CRM software thanks to a connector:
![CRM Webhook](./assets/images/CRM-webhook.png)

# Getting Started
Do you want to join our developer community as a beta tester ü§òüèΩ? Follow these steps to be part of the adventure:


## Get a Developer Account
To build apps that iAdvize‚Äôs customers can use, first, you need to get a developer account:   

* Apply and sign up by sending a request to developers@iadvize.com,
* The iAdvize team will contact you within 48 hours,
* We provide you with credentials and a testing environment.

## Features Overview
iAdvize provides you with some easy-to-use tools so you can:

* Manager the privacy mode of your app for it to be public or private
* Set up the authentication process for your app
* Define custom settings such as object mapping (in progress)
* Create interactions to enhance some of iAdvize's predefined features
* Use outgoing webhooks to receive updates in real-time

Once your app is ready, you will be able to submit your connector for review.
Then, the iAdvize team will review your app to make sure it fits the Developer Platform policies, and will get back to you within 48 hours (on working days).
And then hurrah... You can publish your app on iAdvize‚Äôs marketplace!

# Build apps
Once you are logged in your developer account, you are ready to build apps.
So let's go through the different sections of the Developer Platform:

## My apps
This is the place where you can see the list of all the apps you have built on iAdvize. You can also see their current status:
* Published: your app is ready to be installed on the iAdvize Marketplace
* Under review: your app has been submitted for review
* Sandbox: you can edit your app

## App information
Our team is still working on the accessibility mode of your app when it is private.
In alpha version, the accessibility mode will be available for you to change manually for the customers you have selected. 

**How does the Private mode work?**
Our team is still working on the accessibility mode under the Private mode.
In alpha version, we will make it available manually for the specific customers you have selected.

## Authentication
The authentication section is where you set your app‚Äôs needs to retrieve data from iAdvize and the app you want it to be connected to. Users will need to follow these authentication steps to install your app.

**Define authentication fields**
You can add fields and define the type of entry you need (text, numeric, etc.).

* Label: it‚Äôs the name of your field, this is what users will see.
* Type: it defines the type of entry (text, numeric, alphanumeric).
* ID: you should choose the name of your field ID according to your code.

You can add as much fields as you need.
This is the first thing users will see once they click on the "install" button on the iAdvize Marketplace.
Fields appear to users according to their order of creation (the 1st entry created is the 1st on displayed on the page).

*i.e. if your primary goal is to know your users‚Äô usernames, it is the first information you should ask them for.*

* Configure your verification URL
This is the URL on which we will check your app. It also helps us check if your credentials are valid. We'll call this URL and your connector will be sent back if the authentication parameters have been correctly set up to go to the next installation step.

*i.e. users might be required to authenticate with an email and a password. In this case, you need to create two different fields, one for the email and one for the password.*

![Authentication](./assets/images/developer-authentication.png)


Users have to fill in the fields during the installation process first, on the iAdvize Marketplace.

![Authentication admin](./assets/images/marketplace-configure.png)

## Settings
This part is still under development. This is where you will be able to add specific configuration steps such as mapping.

## Interactions
Add interactions to enhance the iAdvize interface by adding or editing predefined features.

The features that are already available are: 

* The product List (on the discussion panel)
* The visitor profile (on the discussion panel)
* The end of conversation (on the discussion panel)

### The Product List
The integration of the product list enables users to browse a product catalog from the iAdvize discussion panel.
Agents can look for a product while they are chatting and send it in just a click within their conversation.

Products are displayed in the form of a card within conversations: visitors can see their image, title, availability and price.
In just a click on the "view product" button, visitors are redirected to the product page on your website.

![Product list](./assets/images/interactions-product-list-feature.png)

**Add a Product List Connector and Configure it**
In order to set the right connector parameters, all you have to do is declare:
* The product list URL - this is your catalog‚Äôs URL
* The categories url - this is where your connector will get the list of your product categories

#### Example of categories data a connector must return
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
[
    {
        "id": "123",
        "label": "category",
        "idParent": null,
        "productsCount": 3
     },
     {
         "id": "456",
         "label": "category",
         "idParent": null,
         "productsCount": 7
      }
 ]
</pre>

#### Example of products data a connector must return
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
[
    {
        "id": "123",
        "title": "Product's title",
        "productUrl": "http://www.e-commerce.com/url-product",
        "brand": null,
        "description": "product's description",
        "shortDescription": null,
        "available": true,
        "imageUrl": "http://www.e-commerce.com/url-product-image.jpg",
        "reference": null,
        "priceCatalog": "99.9 ‚Ç¨",
        "pricePromotion": null
    },
    {
        "id": "456",
        "title": "Product's title",
        "productUrl": "http://www.e-commerce.com/url-product",
        "brand": null,
        "description": "product's description",
        "shortDescription": null,

        "priceCatalog": "9.9 ‚Ç¨",
        "pricePromotion": null
    }
]
</pre>

Developers have to make their versioning declaration during the submission process.
iAdvize will approve or refuse the app based on specific criteria.
iAdvize will get back to you within 48 hours.

## Webhooks
The webhook system allows external applications to subscribe to events (via callback URLs) to receive updates in real-time.
When you build your app, you can subscribe to a list of events.
When customers install your app, it automatically creates webhooks for these customers as well as for events based on your app's configuration.

This subscription is based on the events happening on different domains. See the list of events available in the [Webhook API documentation](#webhook).

### Create a webhook for your connector
You can create as much outgoing webhooks as you need.
A webhook can cover several events.
An event can be linked to a customer (example customers.website.created)
or linked to a website (example customers.website.created)

* Name of the webhook: an optional label you can give to the webhook
* webhook URL: the server URL that will receive the webhook
* Security token: Token provided by iAdvize (this field cannot be edited)
* Content-type: Application / json ; Application / x-www-form-urlencoded
* Events: you can select the events in the list. You can subscribe to all
iAdvize events, all events of a specific domain, or only one event.


## Developer Policy (in progress)
Developers host their code on their own host service.
Developers are responsible for the connector maintenance.
Developers can set their app‚Äôs price (monthly fee or based on the number of conversations).
If it‚Äôs not a free app, developers must be a legal person.

# API
## REST API
**Current version:** 2.0

This API provides access and basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for the resources described in the documentation.
The REST API uses JSON exclusively. XML is not supported.

### Base URL

All URLs referenced in the documentation have the following base:

| Standard platform | High availability platform |
| --- | --- |
| `https://www.iadvize.com/api/2` | `https://ha.iadvize.com/api/2` |

The iAdvize REST API is served over HTTPS and HTTP.

### Authentication

The API key must be attached to each request. You can use it in one of the following ways:

*   Passed in as a `X-API-Key` HTTP header
*   Passed in as a `key` GET parameter
*   Passed in as the username <small>(with an arbitrary password)</small> via `HTTP Basic authentication`

**Retry management**
iAdvize will retry to send callback in failure X times if http status code isn‚Äôt part of 50x code.

### Delivery headers
iAdvize will send payload with two additionals headers:

### Security
(documentation in-progress)

## Push API

The iAdvize Push API will be deprecated on january 30th, 2018. From now, prefer to use our webhook API.
The Push API allows data to be pushed to URI callbacks when an event is fired.  
The Push API uses JSON exclusively. XML is not supported. Push requests are sent with a POST method.

# Single Sign On

iAdvize offers a [Single Sign On](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) method that allows you to provide a unique authentification system to your operators who are already logged to your app.

## Benefits

If your users have to switch between several apps (including iAdvize) during their daily work, Single Sign On method has some interesting benefits :

*   Reducing password fatigue from different user name and password combinations
*   Reducing time spent re-entering passwords for the same identity
*   Reducing IT costs due to lower number of IT help desk calls about passwords

## Implementation

To connect an operator to its iAdvize console :

*   Get his sso_key in the [operator resource of the REST API](/?p=api2-rest#resource-operator). The sso_key only changes when the operator's email is changed
*   Use it in the following URL : `http://www.iadvize.com/auto-auth.php?auth={SSO_KEY}`

That's all! When a user visit the URL, he will be automatically logged to its iAdvize account and no login / password will be asked to him.

## Use specific links

It's possible to use a specific link with a parameter called `url` to go to a specific page.

Examples below:

| Page | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Discussion panel | `http://www.iadvize.com/auto-auth.php?auth={SSO_KEY}&url=**/pupitre**` |
| Users | `http://www.iadvize.com/auto-auth.php?auth={SSO_KEY}&url=**/users**` |

To find the parameter `url` that interest you, look the URL address of the page in your favorite web browser.

![URL example](./assets/images/sso-url.png)

With this example, the SSO URL address will be:
`http://www.iadvize.com/auto-auth.php?auth={SSO_KEY}&url=**go=offers**`
