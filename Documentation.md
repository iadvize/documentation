# General information
Welcome to iAdvize documentation for developers.
You want to use our API, to create integrations for your own use or for the world? That's the right place.

iAdvize provides you with a Developer platform to easily publish your apps on our marketplace so our users can install them directly from their administration interface.

Whether you are developer, integrator, customer or simply curious, you will find an overview of how to Get started, our Developer Guidelines, our API with output examples, and a guide to build and publish your future integrations.

## What is iAdvize?
[iAdvize](http://iadvize.com) is a SaaS conversational commerce platform. It enables businesses to engage their customers and prospects whether they‚Äôre on the website or on social media from one messaging solution (chat, voice, video).

Visitors can get real-time advice from customer service but also from advocates, members of the brand community.

Implementing iAdvize is child's play. You just have to insert a tag on each page of your website. Once the solution is deployed, your customer service and marketing teams are completely independent and can set up the solution as they wish.

iAdvize platform has 2 interfaces:

* Administration: from where Administrators and Managers of the solution can configure the platform's settings and monitor the agent's activity.

* Agent's Console Panel: which give your agents superpowers. That's where professional agents or experts can respond intuitively to all messages.

## What is the Developer Platform?

The iAdvize Developer Platform let developers Build Apps or use our public APIs.
Want to develop an app? You'll be provided with a documentation and a private testing environment.

## Why to build apps to iAdvize?

There are three main reasons for building an app

* Build apps and publish it to our customers community. (We've got more than 500 cust to amaze!)
* Build app in a private mode, and make it available for (a) specific customer(s) only
* Get rewarded based on the usage of your apps

Here is an example of potential protocol between iAdvize and a CRM thanks to a connector:
![CRM Webhook](./assets/images/CRM-webhook.png)

# Getting Started
Wanna join our developers community as a beta tester ü§òüèΩ ? Follow these steps to be part of the adventure.

## Get a Developer Account
To build apps that iAdvize customers can use, you first need a Developer Account.  

* Apply and Sign-Up by sending a request to developers@iadvize.com,
* iAdvize team will get in touch within 48 hours,
* We provide you with credentials and testing environment.

## Features Overview
iAdvize provides you with some easy-to-use tools so you can:

* Set the Privacy mode of your App as Public or Private
* Set Authentication process of your Apps
* Define custom Settings such as object mapping (in-progress)
* Create interactions to enhance some iAdvize's predefined features
* Use Outgoing Webhooks to receive updates in real time

Once your app ready, you will be able to submit your connector for review.
iAdvize team will review your app to make sure it fits the Developer policy, and will get back to you within 48 hours (on workdays).
And then hurrah... Publish it to iAdvize Marketplace!

# Build apps
Once logged in your Developer Account, you will be ready to build.
So let's go through the different sections of the Developer Platform.

## My apps
This is where we list your apps and related status:
* Published: App ready to be installed on the iAdvize Marketplace
* Under review: App submitted for review
* Sandbox: App being edited

## App information
In this section you will input the general information of your app such as the name, the logo and the features description.
You can also set the privacy mode as public or Private.
* Public mode: your app will be viewable and installable by all of our customers
* Private: your app will be available for the customers you choose

**How does the Private mode work?**
Our team is still working on the accessibility mode under the Private mode.
In alpha version, we will make it available manually for the specific customers you have selected.

## Authentication
The Authentication section let you set what your App will need to retrieve data from iAdvize and the app you want to connect to. The user will have to follow those authentication steps to install your app.

**Define authentication fields**
You are able to add fields and define the type of entry you are waiting for (text, numeric‚Ä¶).

* Label: name the field, this is what the user will see.
* Type: define the type of entry (text, numeric, alphanumeric).
* Id: name the field's id according to your code.

You can add as much as fields you need to.
This is the first thing the user will see once he clicked on "install" from the iAdvize Marketplace.
They will appear to the user according to the creation order (1st entry, 1st displayed on page).

*i.e.: if your first set is about getting "Username", it will be the first information asked to the user.*

* Set the verification url
This is the url on which your App will be checked if credentials are valid.
We'll call this url and your connector can sent back if authentication parameters are correct in order to go to the next step of installation.

*i.e.: the user might be required to authenticate with an email and a Password. You will have to create two respective fields for email and password.*

![Authentication](./assets/images/developer-authentication.png)


The User will have to fill in the fields first thing during the installation process on iAdvize Marketplace.

![Authentication admin](./assets/images/marketplace-configure.png)

## Settings
This part is still under development. This is where you will be able to add some specific configuration steps such as mapping.

## Interactions
Add interactions to enhance iAdvize interface by adding or editing predefined features.

Available features are:

* Product List (Console Panel)
* Visitor Profile (Console Panel)

### Product list feature
The Product List integration enables Users to browse a product catalog from the iAdvize Console panel.
Agents can search for a product during a conversation, and send it in one single click within the chat.

The product are displayed to the visitor in the conversation as a card with the image, the title, the availability and the price.
In just a click on "view product", visitors are redirected to the product page on the related eCommerce website.

![Product list](./assets/images/interactions-product-list-feature.png)

**Add and set a Product list connector**
In order to set the right connector's parameters, all you have to do is to declare:
* the product list url - this is the catalog url
* the categories url - this is where your connector will get the list of products categories

#### Example of categories data a connector must return
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
[
    {
        "id": "123",
        "label": "category",
        "idParent": null,
        "productsCount": 3
     },
     {
         "id": "456",
         "label": "category",
         "idParent": null,
         "productsCount": 7
      }
 ]
</pre>

#### Example of products data a connector must return
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
[
    {
        "id": "123",
        "title": "Product's title",
        "productUrl": "http://www.e-commerce.com/url-product",
        "brand": null,
        "description": "product's description",
        "shortDescription": null,
        "available": true,
        "imageUrl": "http://www.e-commerce.com/url-product-image.jpg",
        "reference": null,
        "priceCatalog": "99.9 ‚Ç¨",
        "pricePromotion": null
    },
    {
        "id": "456",
        "title": "Product's title",
        "productUrl": "http://www.e-commerce.com/url-product",
        "brand": null,
        "description": "product's description",
        "shortDescription": null,
        "available": true,
        "imageUrl": "http://www.e-commerce.com/url-product-image.jpg",
        "reference": null,
        "priceCatalog": "9.9 ‚Ç¨",
        "pricePromotion": null
    }
]
</pre>

### Closing conversation feature (in-progress)
This type of interaction is not available yet.

### Submit your apps

Apps must be submitted to iAdvize for review.
The versioning declaration must be done by the developer during the submission process.
iAdvize will approve or refuse the app based on specific criteria.
iAdvize will get in touch within 48 hours to the developers.

## Webhooks
Webhook system allows external applications to be able to subscribe to events (via callback urls) to receive updates in real time.
When you build your app, you can subscribe to a list of events.
When client install your app, it automatically creates webhooks for this client as well as events based on your app's configuration.

This subscription is based on the events of the different domains. See the list of available events in the [Webhook API documentation](#webhook).

### Create a webhook for your connector
You are able to create as much as outgoing webhooks you need to.
A webhook can cover several events.
An event may be linked to a customer (example customers.website.created)
or a site (example customers.website.created)

* Name of the webhook: Optional label to be given to the webhook
* URL of the webhook: the URL of the server that will receive the webhook
* Security Token: Token provided by iAdvize (this field is not editable)
* Content-type: Application / json ; Application / x-www-form-urlencoded
* Events: select the events from the list. You have the ability to subscribe to all
* iAdvize events, all events of a specific domain, or only one event.


## Developer Policy (in-progress)
The developer will host the code on his own host service.
The developer will be responsible of the maintenance of the connector.
The developer is able to set the price (monthly fee, or conversation based).
If the app is not free, the developer must be a moral person.

# API
## REST API
**Current version:** 2.0

This API provides access and basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for the resources described in the documentation.
The REST API uses JSON exclusively. XML is not supported.

When an event occurs, an HTTP POST call is issued on the callback urls you set up with the event data. 
Data is sent with ‚Äúapplication/json‚Äù header content-type, and ‚Äújson‚Äù format as payload. 
Callback urls must be defined with HTTPS protocol and should be available with POST and GET http verbs:
- POST verb to send data payload,
- GET verb, to let iAdvize check the availability of the callback (more information in security section below).
iAdvize expect to have √† 20x http status in callback result.

# Single Sign On

iAdvize offers a [Single Sign On](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) method that allows you to provide a unique authentification system to your operators who are already logged to your app.

## Benefits

If your users have to switch between several apps (including iAdvize) during their daily work, Single Sign On method has some interesting benefits :

*   Reducing password fatigue from different user name and password combinations
*   Reducing time spent re-entering passwords for the same identity
*   Reducing IT costs due to lower number of IT help desk calls about passwords

## Implementation

To connect an operator to its iAdvize console :

*   Get his sso_key in the [operator resource of the REST API](/?p=api2-rest#resource-operator). The sso_key only changes when the operator's email is changed
*   Use it in the following URL : `http://www.iadvize.com/auto-auth.php?auth={SSO_KEY}`

That's all! When a user visit the URL, he will be automatically logged to its iAdvize account and no login / password will be asked to him.

## Use specific links

It's possible to use a specific link with a parameter called `url` to go to a specific page.

Examples below:

| Page | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Discussion panel | `http://www.iadvize.com/auto-auth.php?auth={SSO_KEY}&url=**/pupitre**` |
| Users | `http://www.iadvize.com/auto-auth.php?auth={SSO_KEY}&url=**/users**` |

To find the parameter `url` that interest you, look the URL address of the page in your favorite web browser.

![URL example](./assets/images/sso-url.png)

With this example, the SSO URL address will be:
`http://www.iadvize.com/auto-auth.php?auth={SSO_KEY}&url=**go=offers**`
